          Every year, over 467,000 college-aged students and younger are
          reported missing in the United States alone. These numbers are even
          more staggering globally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Statistics show that women are more likely to fall victim to
          kidnapping, human traffickng, sexual assault, and domestic abuse. As a
          woman myself, I have lived through my own experiences as well as heard
          from other women detailed accounts of the dangerous situations they
          have found themselves in.
        </p>

        <p>
          The truth is, nearly every woman can recall a time in her life where
          she felt unsafe. The current solutions that exist around personal
          safety for young women are few and far between, and among the ones
          that do, they unfortunately leave costly gaps. It&#39;s time we had a
          safer, faster, and more reliable solution to help in emergency
          situations when we need it most.

          Whether its gripping our keys through our fingers as we walk to our
          cars at night, remembering our pepper spray on a blind date or a night
          out with friends, or making sure our phone is charged and on us at all
          times- there are so many mental gymnastics that we as women have to
          jump through to ensure our safety. Yet statistics show us that it is
          still not enough.

        <p>
          This is not only true for abductions, but for many other situations in
          which a person&#39;s safety is being threatened. Along with being
          taken, a cell phone could run out of battery or not be immediately
          accessible in a dangerous situation. Once a person loses access to
          their phone, the chances of getting them help or even letting someone
          know they are in trouble are incredibly slim.

          Through wearable technology and a distinct understanding of our
          market, Haven&#39;s goal is to provide safety and peace of mind at
          times you need it most. Haven is inconspicuous and fashion forward,
          while providing a faster connection to responders in the case of an
          emergency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our initial product is a watch that utilizes GPS technology and audio
          capabilities to track a person&#39;s location and record exactly what
          is going on in an emergency situation. The Haven watch has unique
          features that differentiate it from competing technology such as being
          untethered to your phone, its ability to be concealed from predators,
          and its proximity to the body during natural fight-or-flight
          responses.

          During onboarding, users will be required to verify their identity
          through facial recognition software and uploading a proper form of
          identification. They will then be prompted to fill out their profile
          with key descriptive information that authorities can use in an
          emergency situation to help identify them. Having this information
          on-hand and ready for emergency responders will eliminate the need for
          introductions during dangerous situations when time is of the essence.

          While Haven&#39;s full offering and features will require a wearable
          watch with a premium plan, we will also offer a Haven LITE version
          that is free for anyone to use when needed. Haven LITE will allow a
          user to pre-share your scheduled journey with your safety network,
          allowing them track your journey to make sure you reach your
          destination safely.

          The Haven watch has GPS tracking and audio recording capabilities
          built into it to track a person&#39;s location and record exactly what
          is happening in an emergency situation. Audio recordings can later be
          used as evidence in the court of law. When activated by a simple twist
          of the watch face, an alert will be sent out to a user&#39;s safety
          network consisting of five emergency contacts letting them know you
          need help immediately.

          Once the watch is activated and the alert is sent out, your safety
          network will be notified to be on stand-by to make sure you are safe.
          Your safety network will be given one-time access to your location,
          allowing them to track your movements in real-time. A grace period
          will begin after the alert has been sent out. If a reasonable amount
          of time has gone by coupled with no activity from you, the user who
          sent it, a private security service will then be contacted to get you
          more immediate help. From there, authorities will be notified and sent
          to your location to help you.

          While Haven does offer the Haven LITE free version that requires your
          cellphone to access, Haven&#39;s premium plan does not require
          bluetooth or access to your cellphone at all to work in an emergency
          situation. Haven partners with mobile device carriers to use LTE when
          activated for an additional fee tacked on to your cellphone bill each
          month. This will provide optimal peace of mind to you, knowing you can
          still get the help you need when you need it most despite your phone
          dying or being taken from you.

          Haven is designed to take advantage of reaction times, proximity to
          the body, and natural fight-or-flight responses through its unique
          design and features. When designing the product, we focused on the
          responses that humans instinctively make when put in dangerous
          situations. This includes putting your hands up to protect your heart,
          your face, or your head when scared. In all of these positions, your
          Haven watch can be easily accessed on your wrist and activated to your
          advantage, saving you precious time to get you the help you need
          immediately.
